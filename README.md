# Weather
An app that tracks exact location coordinates and pulls weather data from OpenWeatherMap API.

## What I Learned
* Configured "Location Manager" in order to get real time current locations
* Updating the API based on coordinate location rather than city location for accuracy 
* Used JSON in order to parse out all information from the OpenWeatherMapAPI
* Configured decodable protocols to use JSON
